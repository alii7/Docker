docker run hello-world          # to create container(an instance of an image)
sudo docker run -it centos /bin/bash      # -it(interactive mode), /bin/bash( run the bash shell once CentOS is up and running)
docker images                # to see the list of Docker images on the system
docker rmi ImageID           # to remove Docker images on the system
sudo docker images -q        # to return only the Image IDâ€™s of the images
docker inspect image_name    # to see the details of an image or container  (image_name = Repository)
docker ps                    # to list all of the containers on the machine (currently running)
docker ps -a                 # to list all of the containers on the system
docker history ImageID       # to see all the commands that were run with an image via a container
docker history image_name    # to see all the commands that were run with an image via a container
docker top ContainerID       # to see the top processes within a container
docker stop ContainerID      # to stop a running container
docker rm ContainerID        # to delete a container
docker stats ContainerID     # to provide the statistics of a running container (CPU and memory utilization of the Container)
docker attach ContainerID    # to attach to a running container

Once you have attached to the Docker container, you can run the above command to see the process utilization in that Docker container

docker pause ContainerID     # to pause the processes in a running container
docker unpause ContainerID   # to unpause the processes in a running container
docker kill ContainerID      # to kill the processes in a running container
